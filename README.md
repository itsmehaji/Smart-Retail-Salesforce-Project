# 🛍️ Project Brief: Smart Retail Management System using Salesforce LWC

This project is about building a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) that works like a smart checkout + customer engagement system for retail stores.

# 🔹 What it does:

* Product Scanning → A camera in the LWC scans barcodes/QR codes on products.

* Smart Cart System → Each scan adds items into a virtual cart with auto-calculated totals.

* Customer Association → Purchases are linked to customer records in Salesforce.

* Automated Notifications → Customers get expiry reminders (e.g., 2 days before expiry) and personalized offers during sales/festivals.

* Data Management → Batch processes clean old/expired product data.
  
# End Result:
A retailer can use Salesforce not just as a CRM, but also as a retail automation platform that improves checkout speed, customer loyalty, and sales campaigns.
